<p>
La Casa de Papel (a.k.a Money Heist), one of our favorite Spanish-language shows on Netflix, is definitely returning for season 5. However, this news is bittersweet: The fifth season will be the show's last.

Given Money Heist's success, and the characters' personalities, the series's renewal for one more season is no surprise. After all, the Casa de Papel crew has never turned down a chance to pull off a high-stakes robbery. After walking away with â‚¬984 million from the National Mint of Spain, one would think that La Casa de Papel/Money Heist's robbers would unzip their red jumpsuits and retire with their fortune. But you'd be wrong. Much like Danny Ocean of the Ocean's Eleven series, the Professor and his friends are always game for another heist.

What will happen in season 5? Will they rob the U.S. Mint? Disappear with every ATM on the European continent? Hypnotize the world with a rendition of "Bella Ciao?" We wouldn't put any of these ideas past the Professor.

While it's uncertain when season 5 of La Casa de Papel will land on Netflix, here's what we do know: For as long as the Professor keeps dreaming up plans, the show's passionate fan base will tune in.

  <h3 id = "SecondH3"> El Profesor </h3>

<p>
El Profesor (Sergio) is highly intelligent and meticulous. He appears to be very determined to pull off the greatest money heists in history, after planning for it for several years. Once he recruits his dream team, he makes everyone religiously follow a strict schedule, complete with fundamental rules to prepare for and execute the heist. His perfectionist attitude is apparent through his careful consideration and planning for all possible scenarios that could arise during the heist. This forward-thinking approach helps him in his strive for perfection, where he urges the team to 'stick to the plan' in every situation.
The Professor appears to have exceptional knowledge in negotiation tactics, police strategy, weaponry, law enforcement, hostage crises aversion, forgery, theft and bank robberies. He was able to control the entirety of the heist from behind the scenes, playing with the police and constantly tricking them into doing exactly what he wanted them to do. He also demonstrates a deep understanding of human psychology. A majority of his plans gravely depend upon the reactions he predicts from the police, the government, and the public. This allows him to play a tense game of one-upmanship with Inspector Raquel Murillo, where he repeatedly manages to shift the status quo in favor of his team during the heist, despite overwhelming odds.
