La Casa de Papel (a.k.a Money Heist), one of our favorite Spanish-language shows on Netflix, is definitely returning for season 5. However, this news is bittersweet: The fifth season will be the show's last.

Given Money Heist's success, and the characters' personalities, the series's renewal for one more season is no surprise. After all, the Casa de Papel crew has never turned down a chance to pull off a high-stakes robbery. After walking away with â‚¬984 million from the National Mint of Spain, one would think that La Casa de Papel/Money Heist's robbers would unzip their red jumpsuits and retire with their fortune. But you'd be wrong. Much like Danny Ocean of the Ocean's Eleven series, the Professor and his friends are always game for another heist.

What will happen in season 5? Will they rob the U.S. Mint? Disappear with every ATM on the European continent? Hypnotize the world with a rendition of "Bella Ciao?" We wouldn't put any of these ideas past the Professor.

While it's uncertain when season 5 of La Casa de Papel will land on Netflix, here's what we do know: For as long as the Professor keeps dreaming up plans, the show's passionate fan base will tune in.
